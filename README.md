![Ace Popup Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrkkrp/ace-popup-menu/gh-pages/ace-popup-menu.png)

This package allows to replace the GUI popup menu (created by `x-popup-menu`
by default) with a little temporary window (like the one in which Dired
shows you files you want to copy). In this window, menu items are displayed
and labeled with one or two letters. You press a key corresponding to
desired choice (or <kbd>C-g</kbd> if you wish to cancel the operation) and
you are done.

## Installation

Download this package and place it somewhere, so Emacs can see it. Then put
`(require 'ace-popup-menu)` into your configuration file. Done!

It's available via MELPA, so you can just <kbd>M-x package-install RET
ace-popup-menu RET</kbd>.

## Usage

In order to replace the standard behavior of `x-popup-menu`, activate
`ace-popup-menu-mode` in your configuration file, like this:

```emacs-lisp
(ace-popup-menu-mode 1)
```

You can toggle/activate it either interactively or via Lisp. The mode
follows all usual Emacs Lisp conventions for minor modes, except it's always
global (because it doesn't make any sense to replace behavior of
`x-popup-menu` only in a specific buffer). See the documentation for
`ace-popup-menu-mode` for more information.

You can use the enhanced menu directly via `ace-popup-menu` too. To use it
you don't need to enable the minor mode. See documentation of the function
for detailed information.

## With Flyspell

A popular use case for this package is in conjunction with Flyspell. I
personally use the following function for quick correction of misspellings:

```emacs-lisp
(defun mk-flyspell-correct-previous (&optional words)
  "Correct word before point, reach distant words.

WORDS words at maximum are traversed backward until misspelled
word is found.  If it's not found, give up.  If argument WORDS is
not specified, traverse 12 words by default.

Return T if misspelled word is found and NIL otherwise.  Never
move point."
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((Δ (- (point-max) (point)))
         (counter (string-to-number (or words "12")))
         (result
          (catch 'result
            (while (>= counter 0)
              (when (cl-some #'flyspell-overlay-p
                             (overlays-at (point)))
                (flyspell-correct-word-before-point)
                (throw 'result t))
              (backward-word 1)
              (setq counter (1- counter))
              nil))))
    (goto-char (- (point-max) Δ))
    result))
```

It works nicely with `ace-popup-menu-mode` enabled.

## Customization

You can ask Ace Popup Menu to show headers of individual panes (they are not
shown in the original GUI popup menu):

```emacs-lisp
(setq ace-popup-menu-show-pane-header t)
```

This variable can be changed via the “customize” interface as well.

This package is built on top
of [`avy-menu`](https://github.com/mrkkrp/avy-menu), see its customization
settings if you wish to change appearance of the menu itself.

## Limitations

Here is something you may want to know:

* The original `x-popup-menu` can take `menu` argument in the form of a
  keymap or list of keymaps. This is currently not supported. If you run
  into a situation when this breaks something,
  please [open an issue](https://github.com/mrkkrp/ace-popup-menu/issues).
  Describe how to reproduce your problem and I'll try to fix it.

* Some packages, such as `flyspell`, may test if they work under X-window
  system and refuse to call `x-popup-menu` if they think it's unavailable.
  There is nothing I can do about it, so it may be hard to use Ace Popup
  Menu in terminal, even though it's perfectly capable of functioning there.

* Currently only horizontal format of menu items is available. This is
  because it's much easier to implement. This should not be a problem,
  though.
